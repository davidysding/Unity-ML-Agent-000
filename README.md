 ML-Agent practice based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPFU30tbyKs&ab_channel=CodeMonkey

## ML-agent dependecy
The ML-agent dependecy is based on the [release 10](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/releases/tag/release_10). 

## How to use it?
To use the project, simply follow the [ToolKit Documentation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_10_docs/docs/Readme.md) to install the environment, such as python virtual environment, Pytorch and so on. Then open up the Ready scene in Scene folder to train your own neural network AI. 
To skip the training process and see the trained result from me, then open up the Trained scene.
